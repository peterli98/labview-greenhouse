Project Description:

This greenhouse determines the current temperature and humidity 
within the room and adjusts its physical features accordingly.

Functionality:

1. When temperature is high and humidity is high. Windows and door opens.

2. When temperature is low and humidity is low. The heater turns on and the greenhouse start sparying water onto the plants.

3. Whenever humidity is low water will always be sprayed.

4. Whenever temperature is high heater will always be turned on.

5. For safety reasons, there is a light sensor on the door, and a light bulb shining light to the sensor. Its programmed that if the light is blocked then the door will stop closing because if a person is going through the door we don't want the door to shut on him/her.
